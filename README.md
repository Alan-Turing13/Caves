I wanted to practise some more OOP in Java. 
This is a text-based spiritual adventure game (that well-known genre) which I had started building in Python but never got time to finish. 
So it seemed like the perfect candidate for sinking my teeth into a larger Java project.

Originally I'd had problems with the countdown timer when coding the game in Python. 
I found the threading a lot harder to figure out and ended up getting too frustrated. 
Keeping track of all the if conditions was tricky at some stages of the process.

As with most projects I enjoyed wiring up all the sounds. 
It was also fun to tell more of a story through programming than I might get to building a business logic app. 
Packaging into JAR format was satisfying.

Ideally I'd like to scale this game way bigger than it currently is. 
Although it has a beginning and an end I feel there's a larger story to tell here. 
What would also be good is to incorporate some visual art.
