OOP in Java. 

This is a text-based spiritual adventure game (that well-known genre) which I had started building in Python but never got time to finish. 

Originally I'd had problems with the countdown timer when coding the game in Python. 
This turned out to be less of an issue in Java.

The hardest part of making this game was keeping on top of all the if logic.

As with most projects I enjoyed wiring up the sounds. 
It was also fun to tell more of a story through programming than I might get to building a business app. 

Ideally I'd like to scale this game way bigger than it currently is. 
Although it has a beginning and an end I feel there's a larger story to tell here. 
What would also be good is to incorporate some visual art.
